*VISUAL TICTACTOE PROGRAM* (version 1.0)
This is a Java program that allows you to play the venerable game of tic tac toe. I decided to write the program as a bonus assignment for an OOP class at my university. The code is completely original since I couldn't find a tic tac toe source code that actually worked on the internet, let alone a program written in Java AND a program with a decent UI. I learned that a "simple" game like this can take a lot of work. And I learned that making a UI in XML is slow, so I used the UI development tool Scene Builder by Gluon. If you decide to read my source code, you'll find that there are plenty of comments to explain the design and how it works.

*GETTING STARTED*
If you want to find the source code then you can find the files at --> TicTacToe\src\tictactoe
And if you want to run the program you can either run it in your IDE or navigate to --> TicTacToe\out\artifacts\TicTacToe_jar
You will need a Java JRE to run the game, which is a JAR file.

*BUILT WITH*
-IntelliJ IDEA (Java 9)
-Scene Builder (FXML)

*UPDATES*
-I reformatted some of this document to make it easier on the eyes. And also to announce that I will be changing the source code of my tic tac toe project since I realized that some lines of code could be improved.
-Updated this document just to point out that the UI is an FXML file, not XML.
